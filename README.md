# BikeGame
  This was a project that I worked on mostly from winter to spring of 2015 as my final project for my AP Computer Science class. 
Unfortunately, it didn't come particularly close to completion. The initial vision was to create a 2D platforming motorcycle game 
(one might say similar to a game like linerider), with level creation and editing capabilities. I also planned on building in a 
physics engine from scratch (having no experience whatsoever with game physics, I figured it couldn't be that hard, right?).

  The part of this project I was particularly proud of was that I did build a reasonably usable and functional level creation system, 
with the ability to create and modify complex platforms, move the player's start and finish positions, and save/load created levels 
to/from files. I had also set up some nice menus for changing settings, including the gravity (would've integrated perfectly with my 
physics engine, I'm sure), acceleration and speed of the motorcycle, and framerate of the player. I even spent a while making a neat 
system for remapping keybinds for the controls.

  But, in the end, of course, I had no idea what I was doing when it came to the physics engine. I kept putting it off and making other new
features until the project was due and all I really had was a cool level editor and some settings menus.

As of writing this, BikeGame is still the largest (in terms of amount of code) project I've worked on, so I feel like leaving it up here
for the memories and in case, for some reason, I feel like resurrecting it in the future. (of course, I had no idea what actually
documenting code looked like at the time so the likelihood of being able to understand how everything worked is pretty minimal)
